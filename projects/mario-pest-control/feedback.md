I really can't see anything in this project to give feedback on.  Everything in the HTML, CSS, and JS is clear and easy to read.

The only thing that I saw that is not in the right place is an <h1></h1> you have inside of your <head> element on the HTML.
Otherwise, great work! You are where you should be if not ahead at this point, so keep it up.
